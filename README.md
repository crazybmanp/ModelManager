# Model Manager
This is a tool to handle stable diffusion Loras (Looking to support checkpoints and other models later) for AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui. It manages the files in a format compatable with SDWebUI's storage, a model file, with SDWebUI's .json next to it, and then a .png with the same name for a preview. Added to that, we store a .url file (drag from chrome's url bar) with the same name to store a link to the model's card.

This tool and all of its functionality has been designed to work for my workflow, and in the future I hope to add more sidecar files to support more metadata and expand that, however your setup will have to be close to mine in order to get the full use out of this tool for now.
